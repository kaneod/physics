# This used to be called "Bits of Python for Physics", but that was starting
# to annoy me when I was creating clones on my computers. So here we are.

# The old title was a misnomer, because these code fragments/libraries
# aren't actually all in python (to be honest, they aren't all about physics
# either!).
#
# Mostly, the files here are for doing things like converting the outputs of
# various electronic structure codes into inputs of other electronic structure
# codes, or to formats readable by molecular viewer software.
#
# There are also plenty of little transformation functions that are useful
# for manipulating molecular/crystal structure and so on.
#
# In general the philosophy here is to write everything in python and if 
# speedup is necessary, use fortran and f2py. The exception is in
# reading/writing binary files written by other codes themselves written in
# fortran - in that case it is usually easier to write the routines here also
# in fortran. 
#
# It is often said that professional programmers reuse. I'm not a professional
# programmer in any sense: I don't claim that much of what is here has not been
# solved before, it's just that it's usually faster for me to write my own
# routine rather than try to learn the interface to someone elses. In some cases
# I would have liked to use someone else's code: particularly, if there is a 
# way to parse text files of wildly different formats in a structured and
# sensible way in python without having to actually use a lexical analyzer at
# the compiler-level of complexity, I'd love to know about it. Anyone?
#
# The code here is written in (and for) Python 2.7 and most of it requires
# the numpy and scipy libraries (in one case, Scientific Python is also
# required).
#
# I am happy for other people to use and/or contribute to the codes here, with
# the proviso that it is all GPLv3-licensed. See the COPYING file for more
# details.
#
# Feedback, queries, comments should be sent to:
#
# kane dot odonnell at synchrotron dot org dot au
#
# at least until the end of 2013. After that, try searching for me
# on the web and don't get confused with the Kane O'Donnell from New Zealand 
# who ALSO happens to study physics. I'm the one from Australia!
