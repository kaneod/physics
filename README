# This used to be called "Bits of Python for Physics", but that was starting
# to annoy me when I was creating clones on my computers. So here we are.

# The old title was a misnomer, because these code fragments/libraries
# aren't actually all in python (to be honest, they aren't all about physics
# either!).
#
# Mostly, the files here are for doing things like converting the outputs of
# various electronic structure codes into inputs of other electronic structure
# codes, or to formats readable by molecular viewer software. Codes of
# particular focus are FHI-aims, Quantum Espresso and CASTEP, with the latter
# two the subject of more recent work.
#
# Most things are written in Python for version 2.7 or above, and in many
# cases numpy is required. Very rarely, scipy will also be needed. 
#
# I am happy for other people to use and/or contribute to the codes here, with
# the proviso that it is all GPLv3-licensed. See the COPYING file for more
# details.
#
# Feedback, queries, comments should be sent to:

# kane dot odonnell at curtin dot edu dot au 
# 
# Alternatively, try searching for me on the web and don't get confused with the 
# Kane O'Donnell from New Zealand who ALSO happens to study condensed matter 
# physics.
# 
# I'm the one from Australia!
